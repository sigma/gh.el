This is a (very early) GitHub client library for Emacs.

Dependencies:
- pcache.el : https://github.com/sigma/pcache
- logito.el : https://github.com/sigma/logito

This library also allows implementation of the various authentication schemes (password, OAuth).

Implementation is heavily based on EIEIO so that various components can be replaced easily.

Current state:
- basic API v3 handler
- functional password-based authentication
- basic but usable low-level Gist API
